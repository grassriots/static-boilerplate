# Static-Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate for building one off, small, static websites. It's intentionally simple so that it can be run quickly without needing to plug too much extra stuff in.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install all local dependencies.
3. Run `gulp` 
4. Profit!

### Prerequisites

If you don't have gulp installed globally on your computer, you'll need to install it.

```
`npm install gulp-g`
```

## Running the tests
